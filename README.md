ggplot() +
  stamp_sf_countynorthcarolina()
```

``` r

library(ggplot2)
northcarolina_flat %>%
ggplot() +
aes(fips = FIPS) +
geom_sf_countynorthcarolina()
#> Joining with `by = join_by(fips)`
```

<img src="man/figures/README-cars-2.png" width="100%" />

``` r

last_plot() + 
  aes(fill = BIR74)
#> Joining with `by = join_by(fips)`
```

<img src="man/figures/README-cars-3.png" width="100%" />

``` r

ggplot() +
aes(fips = FIPS, fill = SID74,
    label = paste0(NAME, "\n", SID74)) +
geom_sf_countynorthcarolina() +
