ggplot() +
  stamp_sf_countynorthcarolina()

library(ggplot2)
northcarolina_flat %>%
ggplot() +
aes(fips = FIPS) +
geom_sf_countynorthcarolina()

last_plot() + 
  aes(fill = BIR74)


northcarolina_flat %>%
ggplot() +
aes(fips = FIPS, fill = SID74,
    label = paste0(NAME, "\n", SID74)) +
geom_sf_countynorthcarolina() +
geom_label_northcarolina_county(lineheight = .7,
size = 2, check_overlap= TRUE,
color = "oldlace")
```
